We will analyze the dataset to understand the relation between App Ratings based on App Type/Category and also discover which app has the maximum number of reviews using EDA & Data Visualization.

We will be using the following dataset from Kaggle which contains different play store apps information and has 10.8k rows with 13 columns. 

Dataset: Google Play Store Apps | Kaggle

## Requirements:

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:
     * A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
     * A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
     * A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)      
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.
